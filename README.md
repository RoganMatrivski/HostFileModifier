# gvoze32 Host File Patcher

#### Patch your hosts file, while keeping the rest intact.
---
## WARNING! Currently still unusable.
---
##### What this program does, is simply downloads the latest "hosts" file from [gvoze32/unblockhostid](https://github.com/gvoze32/unblockhostid) repository or other sources, and append them into hosts system file.
##### If you open the repository, they already have the patcher. But, what the program does is replacing the hosts file from system with their own. Which is okay. But, if you already have a lot of configuration in the hosts file, that patcher overwrites it. Which is not good. For me, at least.
##### Current feature of this program is pretty limited for now. But, we will add more feature for the next week or so.
##### Features to add :
- Add more hosts via link or github repository
- Add field for adding hosts alongside with the hosts provided
